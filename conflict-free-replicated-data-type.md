# Conflict free Replicated Data Type

In [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), a **conflict-free replicated data type** \(**CRDT**\) is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) which can be [replicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_%28computing%29) across multiple computers in a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), where the replicas can be updated independently and [concurrently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing) without [coordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control) between the replicas, and where it is always mathematically possible to resolve inconsistencies which might result.
